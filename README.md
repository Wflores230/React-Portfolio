# React-Portfolio

## Link to Deployed Project


## Description
The application contained within is a personal portfolio website built with Reactjs. This project is intended to showcase my personal work achievements and inform others of my technical skills.

## Background
My goal at the end of this bootcamp is to get a position as a junior software developer. This project will help me showcase my learnings in React alongside some of the other projects I have worked on.

## Challenges
Honestly love React and have enjoyed using it on this project. I did have a hard time putting everything together and installing all the packages I needed to complete it. Overall using React has been great and easy to figure out.

## Credits 
Columbia's Full-Stack Web Developer bootcamp for all the assistance and for teaching me all that I have learned.
